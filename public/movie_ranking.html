    <h3>Harry Potter Franchise</h3>
    <p>
      One would see a lot of different reviews about the franchise but for me the movies are amazing.
      The movies have a certain atmosphere and a very dark and gloomy vibe to it which i really like.
      Lots of nostalgia with it and would love if they expand the universe.
